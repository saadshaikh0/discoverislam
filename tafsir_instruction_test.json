That man later embraced Islam and performed Hijrah, but `Ayyash did not know this fact. On the Day of the Makkan conquest, `Ayyash saw that man and thought that he was still a disbeliever, so he attacked and killed him. Later, Allah sent down this Ayah. `Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam said that this Ayah was revealed about Abu Ad-Darda' because he killed a man after he embraced the faith, just as Abu Ad-Darda' held the sword above him. When this matter was conveyed to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, Abu Ad-Darda' said, \"He only said that to avert death.\" The Prophet said to him, \"Have you opened his heart\" The basis for this story is in the Sahih, but it is not about Abu Ad-Darda'."
